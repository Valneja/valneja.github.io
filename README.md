# Life expenses

   __*Web aplication for Web programming*__

## What is Expense Calculator?
It is a web application, that helps you save some money and manage your expenses. It offers the overview of spent and gained money. You can also add and achieve goals that remind you to save some money. Anyone can save some money with that application, because it is easy and fun to use.

## Who can use the aplication?
Anyone who wants know what is happening with their money. It's made for people that want to organise their life and monitor their monthly expenses. 

## What devices are supported?
Mobile devces, tablets and computers.

## Issues
The application was tested on three different browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. The only problem that was encountered was with input type: date. Only Google Chrome supports it, but the application is made so that you can use it in any browser anyway. The example is showing the acceptable format to input the date.

## Other
I invested special effort in building graph of past 12 months credit on accounts.
When I decided to build this application, I put the most thoughts in appearance. I wanted it to look as simple and attractive as possible. I also used my own photos for background.

## What is still missing?
In the future I will add graph that shows you your history of spending money.
